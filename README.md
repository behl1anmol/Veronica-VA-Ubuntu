## Project Description
```
Now-a-days, no doubt there are many virtual assistants available in market but none of them are cross platform
and open source which limits their capabilities and scope. Veronica will be a python powered virtual assistant to
be available cross platform.Veronica reduces work load and help you with your basic day to day computer based tasks
by automating them and reducing human efforts.It is a voice controlled VA which automates the boring stuff as it
mingles with your hard drive and gives the user facility of working with files vocally.User can work with their
machine both offline & online without getting their fingers on keyboard.   Users can get movie ratings,
cricket scores just by  a voice command and much more. Nancy will also be using machine learning for humanly
communication with the user.
